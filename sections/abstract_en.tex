\Abstract
Emulation of hardware that does not profit from native emulation like VT-x or AMD-v carries an enormous performance penalty.
To combat this slowdown, checkpoints get created from already existing emulations,
which get stored in a generalised format to allow for further processing.
To achieve this, the QEMU  machine protocol and the QEMU monitor get used to extract data from a running QEMU instance,
while trying to avoid modifying QEMU-code to keep functionality across multiple QEMU versions.
In addition, this paper gives insights into the internals of emulation and discusses issues with them.
Also it talks about how one may re-inject such data into QEMU,
as there currently exists no standard way to do this.
